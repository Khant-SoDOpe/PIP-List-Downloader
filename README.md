# PIP-List-Installer

## Introduction

**PIP-List-Installer** is a Python command-line application that helps you manage your Python package dependencies with ease. It allows you to log in, sign up, upload your local pip package list to Redis, and download packages from Redis. Below are the features and instructions for using this application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in with their username and password or sign up for a new account.

- **Upload Pip List**: Once logged in, users can upload their local `pip` package list to the cloud using Redis. This is useful for keeping track of your project dependencies.

- **Download Packages**: Users can download packages from their Redis-stored list, making it easy to set up the same environment on different machines.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed
- Access to a Redis server
- Required Python libraries installed (`redis`, `getpass`, `subprocess`, `python-dotenv`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

   ```
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your Redis connection parameters:

   ```plaintext
   REDIS_HOST=your-redis-host
   REDIS_PORT=your-redis-port
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password
   ```

2. Ensure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to your Git repository.

```
python pip_list_installer.py
